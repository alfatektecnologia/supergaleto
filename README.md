# Supergaletto

A project created to help a friend admin his small business.

## Getting Started

The project has a splash screen, an authentication page, a homepage showing products and prices, a product details page, a bag page, and an admin page.

I used Firebase as a backend server.

In the future, a payment solution will be added.

Here are some snapshots of the pages:
